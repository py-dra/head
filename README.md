# **Free Tier Cloud Resource Aggregator**

This project connected multiple free-tier cloud platforms to sum available vCPU and RAM resources across providers.

**This project has been archived due to development challenges and limitations imposed by PaaS providers:**

## **The Initial Question**

> How much RAM and vCPU can I get for FREE? (No credit card, always free)

**Answer: 9.7GB RAM / 5.35 vCPUs**

## **Was It Worth It?**

**No.** This project consumed approximately 70 hours and saved about $170 compared to:
- 2x PRO servers on Render (4GB RAM, 2 vCPUs each)

Or about $25/month compared to Hostinger's introductory pricing (note: Hostinger renews at $24.99/month after initial period). Hostinger also requires significant manual configuration for Docker and GitHub integration, it also doesn't have all the *nice features* PaaS like Render, Railway, Vercel, Koyeb, Zeabur, Fly provide.

**Time vs. Savings:** Depending on the cloud provider comparison, this equates to $2.40/hour or $0.35/hour saved.

## **The Real Value**

I knew from day one that any commercial use violated their ToS. This was always a learning experiment, and in that regard, it was extremely valuable.

**What I learned:**
- Docker and containerization
- HTTP protocols and REST APIs
- Cloud platform architectures
- Peer-to-peer networking
- Backend development principles
- Kubernetes and orchestration
- TCP/IP fundamentals
- Distributed systems challenges
- Virtualization technologies
- CI/CD pipelines
- Distributed Monolith and it's flaws (For real lol)
- Port management and environment variables
- k3s and lightweight Kubernetes
- Global environment configuration
- Time management for technical projects

## **Conclusion**

While not economically viable, this project provided immense educational value in understanding the practical realities of distributed systems and cloud infrastructure.
